# SMT-LIB to Prolog
## An SMT-LIB parser in Prolog

SMT-LIB is an international initiative aimed at facilitating research and development in SMT. Specifically, Version 2.0 defines:
- a language for writing terms and formulas in a sorted (i.e., typed) version of first-order logic;
- a language for specifying background theories and fixing a standard vocabulary of sort, function, and predicate symbols for them;
- a language for specifying logics, suitably restricted classes of formulas to be checked for satisfiability with respect to a specific background theory;
- a command language for interacting with SMT solvers via a textual interface that allows asserting and retracting formulas, querying about their satisfiability, examining their models or their unsatisfiability proofs, and so on.
